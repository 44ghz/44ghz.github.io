		<h3>hey</h3>
		<p>
			My name's George, and this is my website. Hosted on GitHub, it's here to give an idea of who I am, and some of the work that I've done.
			I hope to continue updating it with future work, but in case I forget, any repos will be hosted on <a href="https://github.com/44ghz/44ghz.github.io">my personal GitHub</a>.
			I made this by hand, using no premade templates or styleguides and utilizing various tools which helped strengthen my web development skills.
			Before this I had only done a handful of web pages, and most of them were simple HTML and CSS for a couple classes here and there.
			See more of the development of the website on its <a href="website.html">Project Page</a>.
			<br><br>
			I'm a senior at Winthrop University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Accounting and a planned graduation date of May 2020.
			I'm very much looking forward to beginning my professional career and can't wait to get out there.
			Currently, I've only got a couple classes left, and I'm able to continue working at AgFirst as an Application Development Intern, in addition
			to working at Winthrop as a User Support Technician. Details of my work experience can be found on my <a href="resume.html">Resume Page</a>.
			<br><br>
			In addition to hosting my work on here (using <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub's API</a>), there are also links to my GitHub, which has all my repositories hosted.
			There are also links to my LinkedIn, and a way to email me if you have any questions or comments!
		</p>

		<h3>about me</h3>
		<p>
			I was born in New Jersey and have lived in South Carolina for most of my life. Originally, I was a Chemistry major, and switched to Computer Science after
			my Freshman year; this was definitely the right decision. I've loved the work and experience I've gotten from my courses and my professional work, and it's opened up a lot of
			opportunities and curiosity.
			<br><br>
			In my spare time I like playing video games, landscaping, cooking, and researching hardware. In addition to these, I also hope to learn more about game development in my free time,
			just for fun (also as a way to practice my programming skills in a more relaxed environment).
