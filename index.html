			My name's George, and this is my website. Hosted on GitHub, it's here to give an idea of who I am, and some of the work that I've done.
			I hope to continue updating it with future work, but in case I forget, any repos will be hosted on <a href="https://github.com/44ghz/44ghz.github.io">my personal GitHub</a>.
			I made this by hand, using no premade templates or styleguides and utilizing various tools which helped strengthen my web development skills.
			Before this I had only done a handful of web pages, and most of them were simple HTML and CSS for a couple classes here and there.
			See more of the development of the website on its <a href="website.html">Project Page</a>.

			I'm a senior at Winthrop University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Accounting and a planned graduation date of May 2020.
			I'm very much looking forward to beginning my professional career and can't wait to get out there.
			Currently, I've only got a couple classes left, and I'm able to continue working at AgFirst as an Application Development Intern, in addition
			to working at Winthrop as a User Support Technician. Details of my work experience can be found on my <a href="resume.html">Resume Page</a>.
